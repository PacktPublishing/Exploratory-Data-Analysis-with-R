# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-R[Video]
This is the code repository for [Exploratory Data Analysis with R[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/exploratory-data-analysis-with-r-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The greatest number of mistakes and failures in data analysis comes from not performing adequate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Lack of EDA knowledge can expose you to the great risk of drawing incorrect, and potentially harmful, conclusions from your data analysis.

In this course, you will learn how EDA helps you draw conclusions to make better sense of your data and implement correct techniques. We'll begin with a brief introduction to EDA, its importance, and advantages over BI tools. Using R libraries like dplyr and ggplot2, we will generate insights and formulate relevant questions for investigation and communicate the results effectively using visualizations. You will learn how to spot missing data and errors, validate assumptions, and identify the patterns for understanding the problem. Based on this, you’ll be able to select a correct ML model to use for your data.

By the end of the course, you will be able to quickly get know and interpret various kinds of data sets you will be presented with, and easily understand how to handle and work with them in order to make them ready for further modeling activities.
